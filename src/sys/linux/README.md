This folder is a named place for a Linux backend. It holds this README and nothing else.

**Belongs here:** This README only.

**Does not belong here:** Code of any kind. A file here that is not this README is a defect at this version.

Linux is a named place, not a backend. The revival condition stands on the wiki Platform Support page.

## Native containment probes

An Ubuntu 24.04.5 ARM64 guest running Linux 6.8 verified atomic placement with `clone3`, refusal of a protected worker's attempt to enter a sibling cgroup, refusal of outer cgroup namespace reentry, and protection against a switch to threaded mode.

A worker in the combined user and cgroup namespaces could still kill a disposable sibling through an inherited cgroup mount alias. The guest refused the attempt to make mount propagation private with `EACCES`, so the masked workload was withheld. A Linux backend needs a verified boundary for these controller paths before executing a command.

The archive preserves the C sources, guest commands, raw outcomes, failed first attempt, and cleanup checks. The probes ran in fresh delegated scopes with independent finite deadlines. [Native probe evidence](../../../tests/evidence/linux-cgroup-native-20261106.zip)

**Next:** The wiki Platform Support page states the tier of each named place.
