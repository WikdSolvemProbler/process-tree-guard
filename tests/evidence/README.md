## Contents

- [evidence](#evidence)

This folder holds the recorded evidence of the suite. A test holds each record here to a new run or a new count.

**Belongs here:** The recorded battery record, the summary of the scanner set, the recorded test run, and the preserved `reduced-run` package.

**Does not belong here:** New run results. A new run writes its results in its own run folder.

## Windows correctness reruns

The full Windows x64 suite at b774403 recorded 643 passes and four skips. Both earlier full runs are included. They each reported one infrastructure failure after a Python scale fixture reached its deadline before publishing the complete process list. The final run verified the staged binaries before and after testing. [Raw logs and 647 test certificates](windows-correctness-20261106.zip)

Archive SHA-256 b6254fc68a59ac7d53aa6d4a906e1cc3cf34c72c4ef36cad176bc7358998cc55.

## Linux portable correctness

The exact 47d8f47 archive completed the portable suite on the Tailscale Linux ARM64 guest with 593 passes and 54 skips. The first run reached its guest deadline and recorded a sleeping-launcher test failure before the final traceback. The isolated unchanged test and the full rerun passed. The archive preserves both attempts and independent guest cleanup checks. [Linux correctness evidence](linux-correctness-20261106.zip)

## Owner-pricing timing checks

At `ee885c6`, all five default owner-verification timing tests passed on Windows x64, Linux ARM64, and native macOS ARM64. The class verified actual guard-clock receipts and tested the pricing calculation using the same observations. Both live methods were separately selectable.

The earlier macOS live sleeping-launcher gate failed. All 45 sleep intervals ended before their respective guard clocks opened, but the median prices from the separate conditions differed by 39.2285 ms against a 0.7020 ms bound. The inside-delay sensitivity control passed. The final default tests do not assess stability across separate samples. The live gates retain their original acceptance thresholds and remain available for quiet-host validation.

**Next:** The [`reduced-run` folder](reduced-run/README.md) holds the preserved package.
